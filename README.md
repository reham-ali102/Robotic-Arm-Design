# Robotic Arm Design with 5 Degrees of Freedom using Tinkercad

## Introduction

This project aims to design a 3D robotic arm with 5 degrees of freedom using Tinkercad. The design includes a base, joints, and various moving parts that allow the arm to perform complex movements. The focus of this design is to provide the basic degrees of freedom required for the arm to perform multiple functions.

## Requirements

- An account on [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com)
- Basic knowledge of using Tinkercad and 3D shape design
- A computer with internet access

## Robotic Arm Design

### Base
- **Description:** The base forms the lower part of the arm and allows for horizontal rotation, representing the first degree of freedom.
- **Design:** A cylindrical shape was used to design the base, ensuring it is appropriately sized to support the upper arm.

### Shoulder Joint
- **Description:** The shoulder joint connects the base to the upper arm and allows vertical movement.
- **Design:** The shoulder joint was designed using a smaller cylinder placed above the base.

### Upper Arm
- **Description:** This part represents the upper arm, extending from the shoulder to the elbow. The movement of this part provides the second degree of freedom.
- **Design:** A rectangular or cylindrical shape was used to design the upper arm.

### Elbow Joint
- **Description:** The elbow joint allows vertical movement between the upper arm and the forearm.
- **Design:** The elbow joint was designed using a small cylinder connecting the upper arm and the forearm.

### Forearm and Wrist
- **Description:** The forearm extends from the elbow to the wrist, which contains two joints that provide tilting and rotational movements, representing the remaining degrees of freedom.
- **Design:** Cylindrical shapes were used to design the wrist, providing tilting and rotational movements.

### End Effector (Gripper)
- **Description:** The end effector is responsible for gripping or handling objects.
- **Design:** The end effector was designed in the form of a gripper to allow it to hold objects.

## Advantages

- **Simple Design:** The design is simple and easy to implement using Tinkercad.
- **Degrees of Freedom:** The arm provides 5 degrees of freedom, allowing it to perform a wide range of movements.
- **Scalability:** The design can be enhanced by adding sensors or integrating it with other software for motion simulation.

## Next Steps

- **Motion Simulation:** Additional software can be used to simulate the motion of the robotic arm.
- **Adding Sensors:** Sensors can be added to improve movement accuracy.
- **Design Improvement:** The design can be refined to be more realistic and 3D printable.
